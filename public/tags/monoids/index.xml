      <title>Day 91 - Why Monoid?</title>

      <description>Why Monoid? In my last post I was quite technical on how to Monoid and what the text book definition of a Monoid is. But what is the point of it? You could just write a function that does the same.
But Monoids are just abstractions of a common pattern which appears often, Monoids allow you to abstract this common pattern into a set implementation so it can be easily used to construct datatypes together.</description>

      <description>Monoids This blog post has been in the making for a while as I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully understand Monoids to make a Blogpost on them.
What is a Monoid? A Monoid is a datatype that takes 2 arguments and is governed by 2 laws:
 Applicability : This law states that the order of argument execution does not effect the result.  2+(6+10) == (2+6)+10 == 16 OR ([6,3,7] ++ [4]) ++ [0,8] == [6,3,7] ++ ([4] ++ [0,8]) == [6,3,7,4,0,8]  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter where the parenthesis are, the results are the same.</description>
