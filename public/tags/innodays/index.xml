      <description>Innodays 2018! It has been a while since I last blogged as I was at the HolidayCheck Innodays. Which was so fun, I learnt so much technical stuff and became a lot closer with my work colleagues, t&amp;rsquo;was was great.
Innodays, was a retreat where a select group of people from all of the HolidayCheck offices met in the Bavarian Alps to work together to produce and most importantly ship projects which can benefit the Urlauber.</description>
