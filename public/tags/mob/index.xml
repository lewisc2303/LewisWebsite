      <description>The Business stage Today kinda marked the beginning of the &amp;ldquo;Business&amp;rdquo; stage of the Apprenticeship Programme. This is where I learn ab out HolidayCheck as a business and explore and discover what all the different departments and product teams are doing, but also to get to know everyone better. So every week I shall move my desk to a new team and work with them for a week, I will mainly still be doing my own personal learning but participate in team activities where possible.</description>
