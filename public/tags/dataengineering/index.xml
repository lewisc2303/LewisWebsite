      <description>Data Engineering So this week I joined the Data Engineering team. Their main role is to maintain and refine data for both internal and external purposes. There seems to be quite a bit of complex technologies and frameworks which are intrinsic to the data team such as the data import scheduler and Spark.
I had heard of Spark before and but only that it was used in big data distributed data computation, but never seen it, or looked into how it works.</description>
