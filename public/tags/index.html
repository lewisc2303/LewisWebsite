      Masterpiece Over the last couple of days, I have been planning and coming up with ideas for my masterpiece project. The masterpiece project is the pièce de résistance of the Apprenticeship Programme, it is a project that adds value to the company and allows you to learn new skills and showcase what you&rsquo;ve learnt over the last months.
Success I have come up with an idea and spoke to the correct people about it, but don&rsquo;t want to give too much away at this point for 2 reasons; 1) Things could change, 2) Shouldn&rsquo;t post about company confidential stuff on here.

      Bottighofen, Balance and Javascripty stuff Since Monday I have been in the Swiss office with a team called All Inclusive.
Working on production code In this team I got to take a user-story from Jira, this initial story ended up being far more complicated then predicted, so it needed a lot of assistance.
However yesterday I was given a different minor fix, a classic Javascript undefined error. And I wrote tests for the fix and fixed it!

      Frontend Development As of this week, I&rsquo;ve started to teach myself some key skills for frontend development, this is a world that I&rsquo;ve had little experience with. But it&rsquo;s crucial, not just to for developing front end, but to understand the front end to get a better picture of how a full stack project works.
Last weekend I did some practice through YouTube tutorials on the basics of HTML5, which is straight-forward and tbh not worthy of a blog post.

      Data Engineering So this week I joined the Data Engineering team. Their main role is to maintain and refine data for both internal and external purposes. There seems to be quite a bit of complex technologies and frameworks which are intrinsic to the data team such as the data import scheduler and Spark.
I had heard of Spark before and but only that it was used in big data distributed data computation, but never seen it, or looked into how it works.

      Algebraic Datatypes The strict type system of Haskell is one its key features, it can aid in crafting HOFs, catching errors at compile time and allow for more descriptive code.
Algebraic Dataypes can be categorised into 2 main types:
Sum Type A data structure that contains different fixed singular data constructors. The most familiar being Boolean.
data Boolean = True | False  When no arguments are required for the type constructor, it is referred to as a nullary constructor

      Today I made my first Haskell Project ! It was a text-based hangman game, and it was heavily guided by the book, even-so it brought everything together and it was quite cool actually producing something tangible.
So the basics for setting up any project is by the following commands:
stack new my-project cd my-project stack setup stack build stack exec my-project-exe   stack new builds a project directory for a new Haskell Project stack setup will download or update the necessary GHC compiler stack build will build the minimal project in order to execute teh project.

      Folds Folding is a useful tool for deconstructing data, by reducing about the spine of a list (due to foldable being a type-class, folds can also be performed on other datatypes, but this is not in the scope of the fold chapter I just read).
Folds essentially replaces the cons constructor in a list with a function which takes 2 arguments and applies that function through the list until it reaches the base case.

The cons (:) operator One of these idiomatic Haskellism is the cons operator :. Haskell has 2 ways of defining the List datatype:

      Recursion Is the use of repeated function application, so the self-calling nature of a function. Recursive functions requires a a termination step to avoid stack overflow. The usual layout of this is to make a recursive bottom and the termination steps higher up the code order.
Today I saw myself naturally implementing a TDD approach (very loosely because I&rsquo;m not even implementing test suites into Haskell rn) to creating my recursion model.

But Monoids are just abstractions of a common pattern which appears often, Monoids allow you to abstract this common pattern into a set implementation so it can be easily used to construct datatypes together.

What is a Monoid? A Monoid is a datatype that takes 2 arguments and is governed by 2 laws:
 Applicability : This law states that the order of argument execution does not effect the result.  2+(6+10) == (2+6)+10 == 16 OR ([6,3,7] ++ [4]) ++ [0,8] == [6,3,7] ++ ([4] ++ [0,8]) == [6,3,7,4,0,8]  It doesn&rsquo;t matter where the parenthesis are, the results are the same.

Throughout the book, functions were tested by loading the file into the GHCi and interpreting the compiler error, which is essential to a strictly typed language.

      Algebraic Datatypes The strict type system of Haskell is one its key features, it can aid in crafting HOFs, catching errors at compile time and allow for more descriptive code.
Algebraic Dataypes can be categorised into 2 main types:
Sum Type A data structure that contains different fixed singular data constructors. The most familiar being Boolean.
data Boolean = True | False  When no arguments are required for the type constructor, it is referred to as a nullary constructor

      Folds Folding is a useful tool for deconstructing data, by reducing about the spine of a list (due to foldable being a type-class, folds can also be performed on other datatypes, but this is not in the scope of the fold chapter I just read).
Folds essentially replaces the cons constructor in a list with a function which takes 2 arguments and applies that function through the list until it reaches the base case.

      Referential Transparency Whilst going through some recursion exercises in Haskell, I thought to myself, how is the recursive parameter in a recursive function not mutating? Surely this variable is changing with with every recursive call and therefore breaking referential transparency?
So, I decided to write a blog post about it&hellip;
First of all, what is Referential Transparency?
 Referential transparency is an expression that can be replaced with its value without changing the program’s behaviour.

An example is the Acronym challenge, which requires you to create a function that creates an acronym out of any String argument.

      Recursion Is the use of repeated function application, so the self-calling nature of a function. Recursive functions requires a a termination step to avoid stack overflow. The usual layout of this is to make a recursive bottom and the termination steps higher up the code order.
Today I saw myself naturally implementing a TDD approach (very loosely because I&rsquo;m not even implementing test suites into Haskell rn) to creating my recursion model.

 Applicability : This law states that the order of argument execution does not effect the result.  2+(6+10) == (2+6)+10 == 16 OR ([6,3,7] ++ [4]) ++ [0,8] == [6,3,7] ++ ([4] ++ [0,8]) == [6,3,7,4,0,8]  It doesn&rsquo;t matter where the parenthesis are, the results are the same.

      A break from the book Today I&rsquo;ve been completing some more autonomous and less guided exercises in Exercism. I find these exercises more challenging as it&rsquo;s not focused around the last chapter I read, and forces me to apply everything that I&rsquo;ve learnt and work out the best way.
An example is the Acronym challenge, which requires you to create a function that creates an acronym out of any String argument.

      Recursion Is the use of repeated function application, so the self-calling nature of a function. Recursive functions requires a a termination step to avoid stack overflow. The usual layout of this is to make a recursive bottom and the termination steps higher up the code order.
Today I saw myself naturally implementing a TDD approach (very loosely because I&rsquo;m not even implementing test suites into Haskell rn) to creating my recursion model.

      Referential Transparency Whilst going through some recursion exercises in Haskell, I thought to myself, how is the recursive parameter in a recursive function not mutating? Surely this variable is changing with with every recursive call and therefore breaking referential transparency?
So, I decided to write a blog post about it&hellip;
First of all, what is Referential Transparency?
 Referential transparency is an expression that can be replaced with its value without changing the program’s behaviour.

      Testing in Haskell As in any language, testing is crucial for driving and creating good, maintainable code. And for me, this would be the only criticism of the book, the testing chapter, for being both too vague with the specific implementation with regards to test layout and for introducing it so far into the book.
Throughout the book, functions were tested by loading the file into the GHCi and interpreting the compiler error, which is essential to a strictly typed language.

      Strict, Non-Strict and Lazy Evaluation Haskell can be described as a non-strict language with mostly lazy evaluation. Aber, Was bedeutet das? (Gestern hatte ich meine erste Deutsche Klasse, also werde ich zufällig Deutsch schrieben, damit ich üben kann)
 Non-Strict Evaluation: Non-strict evaluation means that you evaluate an expression from the outside in (as you do in lambda calculus).
 Strict Evaluation: Is obviously the opposite, evaluation starts from the inside out.
