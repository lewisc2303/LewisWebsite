      <description>I have been ill the last few days, so have not written any posts but I did watch a few YouTube videos around on Haskell and JavaScript.
Kata Haskell Kata One particular video made me realise that I have not been using the Haskell type signatures to help in describing the functions well enough, and the video makes a good case stating that type signature declarations aid in code documentation, however I have tended to be lazy and not use type aliases.</description>

      <description>Haskell Blog Today whilst researching Monoids I stumbled across a very informative blog, the best Haskell blog I&amp;rsquo;ve come across yet. The blog is well categorised by level of Haskell competency and explores not only concepts but also the best approaches to learning and using Haskell. It has some cool advanced sections like; AI in Haskell, Haskell Web and Haskell parsing. It also goes into Elm and PureScript AND it&amp;rsquo;s still active!</description>
