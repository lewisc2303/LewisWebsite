# New team and new language

Since finishing the apprenticeship last month, I joined a product team. In this team I am getting involved with the Scala backend services, and so... back to learning Scala.

I started learning Scala when I first joined HolidayCheck but struggled with it as it combined Functional with Object-Orientated in a Java environment. None of which I had experience with. But after learning how to about Functional Programming in Haskell with *Haskell from First Principles* and learning the basics of Object-orientated in Javascript through reading *Elequont JavaScript* and doing my Masterpiece in JavaScript and React.

At first it was daunting again and I feared not being able to understand the language again like last time. But this time is different and my broader knowledge of programming languages has made understand the basic concepts and reasonings for why the language is the way that it is. And the functional theory is the same any any language, so my Haskell knowledge is really handy.

But as I have been writing random markdown files trying to document my learnings and writing notes and concepts in my own word, I thought it better to post them in the blog. As externalising it to the world really helps articulate and abstract your understanding.

So stay tuned for Scala posts...
