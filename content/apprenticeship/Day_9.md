# Day 9

### Testing and tooling

My aim today was to consolidate testing and tooling with learning Scala. And to be honest, I have not got far!

### Git commands from terminal

I spent the morning understanding git in more detail and trying to create, commit and push my Scala projects to the HolidayCheck Github using the terminal. I want to come away from the use of Github apps as I will be switching between my personal and HolidayCheck accounts frequently and the Github desktop does not allow for easy switching.

I did not succeed in this endeavour. There was an issue with merging the repository I made on GitHub with my local repository. They had different histories and it wouldn't let me override the histories and merge them. But... I did learn A LOT of commands and gained a greater understanding of what a Git is, so not a complete waste of time.

i'll attempt it again tomorrow but do repository creation purely from my local directory, so that I do not need to merge.

### Testing

I downloaded some [Scala tests](http://www.scalatest.org/) into my Scala build directory. And then I spent a large proportion of the evening learning test syntax and how to import my code into my test class.

It also took a long time, but I managed to churn out a failed "Hello World!" test. In this case, it wasn't all bad that it failed, because at least it proved that the test framework was working!

I think the test failure issue lied in the string type. But will look into that further tomorrow.

#### TL; DR: One of those days where everything doesn't work the way you want it to!
