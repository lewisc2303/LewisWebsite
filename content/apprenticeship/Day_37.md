# Blog and Retrospective Refactoring

Today I redesigned my website (as you may well have noticed).

### Adding my retrospectives
I added my retrospective to my site in order to archive them for retrospective reference incase I want to have a retrospective of my retrospectives. This formal write-up of my retrospective makes me more familiar with my action items and allows for thorough reflection.

### Making it pretty

I also made it pretty by making it blue with a better font. My old font didn't clearly show the **bolding** markdown.

### Enabling comments
I also added the ability for people to comment on my posts and retrospectives. So now when I summarise what I've learnt in a post, people can critique me if I say something false. This also comes with the ability to leave an emoji response! 

**Leaving an emoji response is a mandatory request to anyone visiting my blogs!**

**I made some progress with the next Haskell chapter but *blergh*, I couldn't get my head around certain syntax for constructing a new type  with an instance of a typeclass. So gonna get back it tomorrow morning.**
