# Day 8

### Sprint
I have decided start implementing *agile* working practices and organsise my learning into *Sprints* which start and finish on the Monday of each week.

My sprint for this week is to learn the basic functionalities of Scala in order to be able to commence a small Scala project next Monday. I shall also try to incorporate testing and tooling techniques into this *Sprint* by downloading and incorporating unit testing frameworks and host my Scala practise on the HolidayCheck Github.

### Scala Practice
So far, not so bad. I've completed the first chapter of:

 > Scala for the impatient - by Cay S. Horstmann

Basically, getting use to importing libraries, using basic operators and familiarising myself with the syntax. It would seem that Scala has lots of specific types and methods [Standard library](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/), but I'm just learning the basics for now and not worrying too much what each type means.

A lot of terminology though. To overcome this I have made a "Scala Arbeitsbuch" to write down terminology that I've read-up about and re-write the definitions in my own words. Such as; Static typing, lazy initialisation and REPL.

#### On to Conditionals...
