# The Business stage

Today kinda marked the beginning of the "Business" stage of the Apprenticeship Programme. This is where I learn ab out HolidayCheck as a business and explore and discover what all the different departments and product teams are doing, but also to get to know everyone better. So every week I shall move my desk to a new team and work with them for a week, I will mainly still be doing my own personal learning but participate in team activities where possible.

### Mob Programming

Today I did some Mob Programming with my team for the week, Team Take-Off. We were adding additional functionalities to a backend code base in TypeScript - a JavaScript language framework to include Types.

And from it I wrote my first bit of production code! It was a small test, but still.

I also was exposed to Nix, which seems okay as long as you do what Nixs wants you to do, if not, error error error.

The session was enjoyable to see how the team shared technology and libraries in order to achieve the cleanest, well-crafted, pretty code.

#### I was involved in the teams daily and sprint planning session, which was insightful.
