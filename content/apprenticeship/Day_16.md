# Day 16

### Challenge accepted

I have decided on a non-work related challenge today. I am going to run in the Munich half marathon on the 14th October.

21 Km of Jogging! Non-stop

This is a big challenge for me as I usually only go for short 20-30 minute jogs (3-5 Km). However i pushed myself yesterday and did 10.2 Km in 1 hour 8 minutes.

>That day, for no particular reason, I decided to go for a little run. So I ran to the end of the road. And when I got there, I thought maybe I'd run to the end of the town. And when I got there, I thought maybe I'd just run across Tierpark. And I figured, since run this far, maybe I'd just run across the great state of Baveria.

Although today my hip-flexors have seized up and even sitting at a desk is proving difficult. But all worth it.

So I have 26 days to double that distance.

Judging from my previous time, the goal would be to finish in under 2 hours 15 minutes.

Tomorrow, i'll post about my experience with Functional Programming.
i've only scratched the surface today, so will save the topic for tomorrow
