# Day 12

#### Back on the Trello board

Today I constructed my daily tasks in the morning using my [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/HIBjDahM/apprenticeship-programme); and it made me more productive. Through having those tasks to achieve in a permanently opened tab in my browser, I have something quick and easy to glance at and therefore know what needs to be done.

I was also much better at staying on track with my current task by keeping it simple and coding the aspect of the language that I'm currently learning.

### Scala and I are friends again

Today I was actually free coding; coding stuff and completing exercises without going on the internet. I'm starting to understand the syntax.

A lot of this is thanks to paired programming, it's allowed me to bounce off my ideas and understanding of methods with someone else, and in doing so has enabled me understand the syntax.

Something I've discovered about Scala is the syntax variations:

An array of range 1 to 5 can be done by:

- val arr = 1 to 5 toArray
- val arr = Array.tabulate[Int](5)(_ + 1)
- val arr = Array[Int](1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
(And there are more)

### End of week 2

Time is flying; second week finished!  Next week the plan is to start a mini project is Scala.
