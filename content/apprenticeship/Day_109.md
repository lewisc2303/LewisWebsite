# Masterpiece

Over the last couple of days, I have been planning and coming up with ideas for my masterpiece project. The masterpiece project is the *pièce de résistance* of the Apprenticeship Programme, it is a project that adds value to the company and allows you to learn new skills and showcase what you've learnt over the last months.

### Success

I have come up with an idea and spoke to the correct people about it, but don't want to give too much away at this point for 2 reasons; **1)** Things could change, **2)** Shouldn't post about company confidential stuff on here. But I'm excited about the idea, as it's a cool concept and it will allow me to develop both the front and backend. So over the Holidays I shall explore react and work on a personal project to be able to run with this idea in January.

Ein bisschen Deutsch... Heute gehe ich nach England fliegen. Ich werde meinen Familien beseuchen und ich entspanne mich näturlich.

Frohe Weihnachten und einen guten Rutsch ins neue Jahr!
