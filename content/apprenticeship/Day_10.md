# Day 10

### IT WORKS (kinda)

Today was quite successful. I wrote code in Scala with tests and it worked! I can do conditionals and basic **for** loops and nearly  completed all the exercises on chapter 2 of:

My issue with Scala is that it is very strongly typed. Most my errors lie in types, and my knowledge of types is limited. At the moment I am just using; **Int, String** and **Boolean**.

Unit type is an odd concept, it's kind of like an empty type. All I know is that it is used for intermediate functions when a type isn't necessary.

Tomorrow, I am going to do some pair programming on Scala with a fellow apprentice.
