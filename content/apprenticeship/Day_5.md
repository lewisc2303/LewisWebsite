# Day 5

### Scala - Sink or Swim

I’ve decided to choose Scala for the following reasons:

-	Used in Microservices and the Data Team at HolidayCheck
-	Data Science/Engineering interests me; we live in a world constantly churning data. Everything we do, the data is stored somewhere and having done lots of Statistics at university, the application of data interests me.
-	It’s completely different to what I’ve done before; not similar to Python.
-	It’s capable of both Functional Programming and Object Orientated Programming; both paradigms which I wish to gain competency in.

Although I don’t know Java or have a clue about Java syntax or its vices and virtues. This is a problem because Scala is perceived as the saving grace to Java and in:

All quirks of Scala are discussed as comparisons to Java. But hopefully this could be a good thing, I will not carry on any habits from Java and start a fresh and learn from the basics.

But oh well, I welcome the challenge!

### Getting organised
Today I also organised myself by creating an online organisation tool called [Trello](https://trello.com/b/HIBjDahM/apprenticeship-programme). The intention of this tool is to focus my learning on specific tasks and keep track of long and short term goals. In this tool I shall organise my *Sprints* which is an *Agile* tool of short-term goal management and reflection. For now, I have decided to make my sprints every week but may change this if tasks seem more apt for a bi-weekly *Sprint*.
