# Testing my NextJS app

As I was starting this project I was playing around with it to get use to the technologies and libraries I was using. And because of that, I have't bee doing TDD. But I really should of been, cause writing test now, has made me really think about my code, and actually what I want each function to do.

### Snapshot testing

Front-end is hard to test with TDD, you can use "enzyme" to test what a react component outputs, but I haven't as I can't fully see the benefit at this stage, as it just tests which child components are produced from a react component and my project is too small have it right now.

Instead I used snapshot testing, this is a type of regression testing and renders the page and all its components and takes a snapshot of that page, this is then stored in a *__snapshots__* folder, and then whenever the test is run again, it shall compare the saved snapshot with the current snapshot, and any differences will fail the test.

### Should I MOCK?
