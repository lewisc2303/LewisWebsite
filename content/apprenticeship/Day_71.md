# Haskell Testing Blog Post pending

So today I was going to write a blog post about testing in Haskell but have not been successful and come across lots of issues.

Hopefully tomorrow I shall sort them out and be able to write a blog post on how I overcame them.

The a general issue with Haskell is that there isn't the wealth of forum posts on how to overcome issues. Therefore googling (other search engine derived verbs are available) a solution to a problem can take a while.

Bis Morgen
