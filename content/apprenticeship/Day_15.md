# Day 15

### From basics to brilliance

A bit OTT naming, but I am committed to the "catchy" naming convention.

One of the Senior Software Engineers has given me guidance to what is needed to grasp the Scala basics; which I have now completed:
I can create immutable and mutable; variables, arrays, lists, maps and tuples. And create objects and loops to apply these methods. The basics.

Now on to the brilliance part. Tomorrow I am going to start researching and applying a programming paradigm; Functional Programming.

From what I know so far, it's a style of programming in which the input is not mutated in anyway to produce an output. It is done purely by arguments which create new outputs.

And some how this is linked to Lamda calculus; a segment of my life which I thought I had left at university. At university I learnt it in an isolated format and without context, so it'll be interesting to see the application of it.
