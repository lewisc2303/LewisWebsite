# Day 19

### Presentation day!

It went quite well actually. There were ~ 8 people in the room and it was also streamed to some people in Bottighofen.

I went as red as a tomato, but didn't let it distract me from my presentation. I got every point across and was prepared for the questions after. And quite good feedback.

My personal critiques would be to be more composed, don't rush and let it flow more naturally. I think I have a tendency to blurt everything out as quickly as possible but I'm sure there will be ample opportunity to try and rectify that in the future.
