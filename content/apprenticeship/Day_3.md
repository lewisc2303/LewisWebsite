# Day 3

### Markdown research

As you can see from the blog post from day 2 (currently writing blog posts a day behind, changing that today by writing 3 and 4 b2b), I learnt new markdown techniques which allowed for snazzier blog posts with the use of [hyperlinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0) and **bold**/*italic* writing. I also tried to create a table however I realised that this was only used in [GitHub](https://github.com/) inspired markdown; which is not supported by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

### Language research

Towards the end of the afternoon I started to look into which language I would like to learn. I read the key chapters of introductory to; Python, Scala and JavaScript. But it’s hard to directly contrast them; there isn’t a better language. I need to do some more reflection on what I want from learning the language and the software developing skills that can be learnt from that language.

My current thoughts are that I haven’t explored enough of Python to be moving onto another language…
