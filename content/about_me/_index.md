I'm originally from Britain where I went to university to study a Masters degree in **Chemical Engineering** and worked for a year in the Industrial gases industry as a Chemical Process Engineer.

The change in career path, from Chemical to Software was a risk which certainly paid off, I have recently finished the HolidayCheck Appreticeship Programme which has given the skills, confidence and fuelled a passion for software. I am naive to a whole lot of topics in software, but excited to learn as much as possible and discover my niche.
